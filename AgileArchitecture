Agile architecture is about designing decoupled and extendable interfaces.

A solution architect in an agile environment needs to follow an iterative re-architect concept by inspecting and adapting the approach.

It's about choosing the right solution for enterprises, communicating well, taking continuous feedback, and modeling in an agile way. 

The foundation of the agile architecture should be reducing the cost of changes, reducing unnecessary requirements by challenging them, and creating a framework to reverse incorrect requirements rapidly.

The Agile architect builds prototypes to minimize risk and plans for change by understanding them. They design the prototype while balancing the needs of all stakeholders and creating a loosely coupled architecture that can easily integrate with other modules.
